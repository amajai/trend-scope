# Scope

clarify_trend_request_instructions = """
These are the conversations exchanged so far with the user requesting trend research:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

The current date is {date}.

Determine whether a clarifying question is needed, or if the provided details are sufficient to begin researching trends for the user's topic.

Important: 
- If a clarifying question has already been asked in the conversation history, do not repeat it unless absolutely necessary. Only ask again if there is a clear gap in the trend research requirements. 
- Ask for clarification only if missing details would significantly affect the quality or direction of the trend analysis.

If acronyms, abbreviations, or unclear terms appear, request clarification from the user.
When asking a clarifying question, follow these rules:
- Be concise but ensure all essential trend-related details are covered.
- Focus on clarifying critical dimensions for trend analysis such as:
  - Timeframe (e.g., past year, last 5 years, current quarter)
  - Geography or region (e.g., global, country-specific, local)
  - Industry, sector, or audience (if applicable)
- Use markdown formatting with bullet points or numbered lists if it improves clarity.
- Do not ask for information the user has already provided.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the trend research scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start trend research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start researching trends based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when clarification is not needed:
- Confirm that the provided information is sufficient
- Briefly restate your understanding of the trend research request
- Indicate that you will now begin the trend research
- Keep it professional and concise
"""


transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt = """
You will be given a set of messages exchanged so far between yourself and the user. 
Your task is to translate these messages into a clear, detailed, and concrete **trend-focused research question** that will guide the research.

The messages that have been exchanged so far are:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide trend research.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on Trend Analysis
- Frame the research around identifying current, emerging, and declining trends related to the user's topic.
- Specify timeframes if the user mentions them (e.g., past year, last 5 years, current month). If unspecified, treat timeframe as open.
- If the user specifies a region, industry, or demographic, explicitly include it. If not, leave it flexible.

2. Maximize Specificity and Detail
- Include all known user preferences (region, timeframe, industry, product type, audience, etc.).
- Explicitly list key dimensions for trend analysis (e.g., adoption rate, market growth, consumer behavior, technology shifts, cultural impact).

3. Handle Unstated Dimensions Carefully
- If critical trend-related dimensions (timeframe, geography, sector) are missing, highlight them as unspecified rather than assuming.
- Example: "Research adoption trends of AI in education, with no specific geography or timeframe provided by the user."

4. Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions
- Do not invent constraints or preferences not stated by the user.
- Treat unspecified aspects as open/flexible.

5. Distinguish Between Scope and Preferences
- Research scope: Trend categories that should be investigated (market adoption, social/media discussions, technological innovations, regulatory changes).
- User preferences: Explicit requirements like country, platform, audience segment, or focus area.

6. Use the First Person
- Phrase the final research question as if I (the user) am requesting it.

7. Sources
- Prefer up-to-date, reliable sources: industry reports, analytics dashboards, reputable news, and official statistics.
- If the topic is product or consumer-based, prioritize market research firms, official company sites, and trusted e-commerce reviews.
- For social or cultural trends, prioritize social media analytics, survey data, and reputable think tanks.
- If the query involves a specific region or language, prioritize local/regional sources.

# Research

research_agent_prompt =  """
You are a research assistant conducting trend research on the user's input topic. 
For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
Your job is to identify and analyze trends related to the user's input topic. 
This includes finding information on current, emerging, and declining trends, supported by credible sources. 
You should highlight timeframes, regions, industries, or demographics if specified by the user. 
Your research is conducted in a tool-calling loop.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to two main tools:
1. **tavily_search**: For conducting web searches to gather trend data and insights
2. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during trend research

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool after each search to reflect on results and plan next steps**
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a human market/trend researcher with limited time. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific trends is the user asking about? 
   - Note explicit dimensions (timeframe, region, industry, audience).
   - Keep unspecified dimensions flexible.
2. **Start with broad trend queries** - Identify general trend reports, news, or market analyses.
3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough evidence of trend direction (growth, decline, emerging)?
4. **Execute narrower searches to fill gaps** - Target missing dimensions like specific demographics, sub-industries, or regions.
5. **Stop when you can describe trends clearly** - Highlight key drivers, supporting evidence, and notable examples.
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Tool Call Budgets** (to prevent excessive searching):
- **Simple trend queries**: Use 2-3 search calls maximum
- **Complex/multidimensional trend queries**: Use up to 5 search calls maximum
- **Always stop**: After 5 search tool calls if no new insights are emerging

**Stop Immediately When**:
- You can identify clear trend directions with supporting sources
- You have at least 3 diverse and credible examples/sources
- Your last 2 searches return repetitive/similar results
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
After each search tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:
- What trend signals did I find? (growth, decline, emerging, stable)
- What dimensions are covered (timeframe, geography, industry, demographics)?
- What's still missing for a comprehensive trend analysis?
- Do I have enough trend evidence to provide a confident answer?
- Should I search more or summarize now?
</Show Your Thinking>
"""

summarize_webpage_prompt = """
You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. 
Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original webpage, 
with special attention to details useful for trend research. 
This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Guidelines for creating the summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Highlight any information that signals trends (growth, decline, emerging patterns, stability, or shifts in behavior/market/technology).
4. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
5. Maintain chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
6. Preserve lists, rankings, or step-by-step instructions if present.
7. Include relevant dates, names, locations, and organizations crucial to understanding the content.
8. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- **News articles**: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Highlight trend-related insights if present.
- **Scientific content**: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions. Note any implications for future directions or emerging fields.
- **Opinion pieces**: Capture the main arguments, supporting evidence, and implications for broader trends.
- **Product/market pages**: Keep key features, specifications, adoption signals, and unique selling points. Include mentions of popularity, reviews, or market positioning.

Length:
- Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information.
- Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Output format:

```json
{{
    "summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
    "key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"
}}
```
Examples:

Example 1 (news article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "On July 15, 2023, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's long-term plan to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated."
}}
```

Example 2 (scientific article):

```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than expected. Satellite data from 1993-2022 shows an acceleration of 0.08 mm/year². The main driver is the rapid melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. If trends continue, sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, threatening coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports. Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century, warned co-author Professor Michael Green."

compress_research_system_prompt = """
You are a research assistant that has conducted research on a topic by calling several tools and web searches. 
Your job now is to clean up the findings, while preserving ALL relevant statements and information that the researcher has gathered. 
For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
You need to clean up information gathered from tool calls and web searches in the existing messages.
All relevant information must be repeated exactly as found (verbatim), but organized in a cleaner format.
The purpose of this step is to:
- Remove duplicate statements
- Remove irrelevant details
- Keep all factual content intact
- Highlight evidence of trends when present (e.g., adoption increasing, market decline, emerging innovations)

For example:
- If three sources all say "X", you may write: "Three sources confirm that X".
- If a source reports "sales are declining year-over-year", keep that exact wording.

Only these fully comprehensive cleaned findings will be returned to the user, so it's critical that you don't lose or rewrite information.
</Task>

<Tool Call Filtering>
**IMPORTANT**: When processing the research messages, focus only on substantive research content:
- **Include**: All `tavily_search` results and external findings
- **Exclude**: `think_tool` reflections and reasoning (these are internal notes and not factual data)
- **Focus on**: Actual information gathered from external sources, not agent reasoning
</Tool Call Filtering>

<Guidelines>
1. Output must be fully comprehensive, including ALL information and sources the researcher has gathered.
2. Repeat information verbatim. Do not paraphrase or summarize.
3. Return inline citations for each source.
4. Include a "Sources" section at the end with corresponding citations.
5. Assign each unique URL a single citation number and reuse it consistently in the text.
6. Number sources sequentially (1, 2, 3...) without gaps.
7. Preserve ALL details: statistics, names, dates, places, data points, and quoted phrases.
</Guidelines>

<Output Format>
The report must be structured as follows:
**List of Queries and Tool Calls Made**
**Fully Comprehensive Findings**
**List of All Relevant Sources (with citations in the report)**
</Output Format>

<Citation Rules>
- Inline citations: [1], [2], [3]...
- Source list format:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Do not skip numbers; ensure sequential numbering.
</Citation Rules>

Critical Reminder: Any detail relevant to the user's research topic MUST be preserved verbatim. 
Do not summarize, paraphrase, or omit trend signals.

"""
lead_researcher_prompt = """You are a research supervisor. Your job is to conduct research by calling the "ConductResearch" tool. 
For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
Your focus is to call the "ConductResearch" tool to conduct research against the overall research question passed in by the user. 
When you are completely satisfied with the research findings returned from the tool calls, then you should call the "ResearchComplete" tool to indicate that you are done with your research.
</Task>

<Available Tools>
You have access to three main tools:
1. **ConductResearch**: Delegate research tasks to specialized sub-agents
2. **ResearchComplete**: Indicate that research is complete
3. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research

**CRITICAL: Use think_tool before calling ConductResearch to plan your approach, and after each ConductResearch to assess progress**
**PARALLEL RESEARCH**: When you identify multiple independent sub-topics that can be explored simultaneously, make multiple ConductResearch tool calls in a single response to enable parallel research execution. 
Use at most {max_concurrent_research_units} parallel agents per iteration.
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Think like a research manager with limited time and resources. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?
2. **Decide how to delegate** - Break the research into distinct sub-questions when appropriate. 
   - Example dimensions: geography, competitors, historical periods, market segments.
3. **After each ConductResearch call, pause and assess**:
   - Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
   - Are results redundant or repetitive?
   - Is further delegation necessary, or should I stop?
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Task Delegation Budgets**:
- Favor a single sub-agent for straightforward questions.
- Use multiple sub-agents only when subtopics are independent and clearly separable.
- Stop when you can answer confidently, or when further searches yield repeated/overlapping information.
- Always stop after {max_researcher_iterations} combined calls to think_tool and ConductResearch if the answer is still incomplete.
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
Before each ConductResearch call, use think_tool to plan:
- Can this be broken into smaller sub-tasks?
- Which dimensions are independent enough for parallelization?

After each ConductResearch call, use think_tool to analyze:
- What new key information did I find?
- What’s missing or unclear?
- Do I have sufficient trend signals (growth, decline, emerging, stable)?
- Should I delegate more or call ResearchComplete?
</Show Your Thinking>

<Scaling Rules>
- **Simple fact-finding, lists, or rankings**: Use a single sub-agent.
  - Example: “List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco” → 1 agent
- **Comparisons or multi-entity analysis**: Use 1 sub-agent per distinct element.
  - Example: “Compare OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind approaches” → 3 agents
- **Multi-dimensional research**: Break down by geography, time, product category, or stakeholder groups.
- Delegate only clear, distinct, non-overlapping subtopics.

<Important Reminders>
- Each ConductResearch call spawns a dedicated research agent for that specific topic.
- Sub-agents cannot see each other’s work. Each must be given standalone instructions.
- Never use acronyms or abbreviations without expanding them.
- Do NOT write the final report yourself — your responsibility ends with gathering research and calling ResearchComplete.

Please create a detailed answer to the overall research brief that:
1. Is well-organized with proper headings (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
2. Includes specific facts and insights from the research
3. References relevant sources using [1], [2], [3] style citations inline
4. Provides a balanced, thorough analysis. Be as comprehensive as possible, and include all information that is relevant to the overall research question. People are using you for deep research and will expect detailed, comprehensive answers.
5. Highlights trend trajectories (growth, decline, emerging, stable) where relevant
6. Includes a "Sources" section at the end with all referenced links

If the findings are incomplete or there are areas without sufficient evidence, explicitly state these gaps as open questions or limitations.

You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:

- To answer a question that asks you to compare two things:
  1/ Introduction
  2/ Overview of topic A
  3/ Overview of topic B
  4/ Comparison between A and B
  5/ Conclusion

- To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things:
  1/ List of things (possibly as a table or bullets)
  2/ Each item in the list as its own section

- To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic:
  1/ Overview of topic
  2/ Concept 1
  3/ Concept 2
  4/ Concept 3
  5/ Conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too.

REMEMBER: Sectioning is flexible. You can structure your report however best fits the question. 
Make sure that your sections are cohesive and logical for the reader.

For each section of the report:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section titles (Markdown format)
- DO NOT ever refer to yourself, AI, the research process, or the tools. The report must read like a professional standalone research document.
- Each section should be as detailed as necessary to fully answer the question with the information available.
- Use bullet points for lists where appropriate, but default to paragraphs.

<Citation Rules>
- Use sequential inline numeric references like [1], [2], [3] in the text.
- End with a ### Sources section that lists each source in numbered order without gaps.
- Format sources as:
  [1] Source Title: URL
  [2] Source Title: URL
- Each source should be on its own line so it renders as a list in Markdown.
- Be precise: users rely on citations to verify information.
