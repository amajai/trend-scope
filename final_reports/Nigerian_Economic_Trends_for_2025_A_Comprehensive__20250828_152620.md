# Nigerian Economic Trends for 2025: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary

Nigeria's economy in 2025 is characterized by a period of ongoing reforms aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. While modest GDP growth is projected, the nation continues to grapple with persistently high inflation. The Naira is showing signs of stability, supported by recent foreign exchange reforms and increased international reserves. Sectoral performance is mixed, with the services and agriculture sectors showing positive momentum, and the oil and gas sector undergoing significant transformation with increased indigenous participation. However, the manufacturing sector faces contraction. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) remains a critical area, with a notable surge in overall capital importation driven primarily by portfolio investments, while direct investment inflows remain modest. Government policies are focused on fiscal sustainability, revenue mobilization, and banking sector recapitalization. Key challenges include high public debt, inadequate infrastructure, persistent food insecurity, and the need for inclusive growth. Strategic imperatives emphasize continued reforms, prudent fiscal and monetary management, and leveraging emerging megatrends.

## Macroeconomic Overview

### GDP Growth and Outlook

Nigeria's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to experience modest growth in 2025. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts a **3.0%** growth [2], while PwC projects a slightly higher expansion of **3.4%** for the second half of 2025 (H2 2025) [3]. This aligns with the 3.13% growth recorded in Q1 2025 [3]. The Nigerian government, however, has a more ambitious target of **4.6%** for real GDP growth in 2025, indicating a gap between official expectations and current economic realities [2].

A significant development in mid-2025 was the rebasing of Nigeria's economy, updating the GDP base year from 2010 to 2019. This exercise increased Nigeriaâ€™s nominal GDP for 2024 by 34.4% to N372.8 trillion (US$243.3 billion) [11]. While this larger GDP figure lowers the debt-to-GDP ratio, it did not restore Nigeria's position as Africa's largest economy, which now ranks fourth behind South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria [11]. Critics argue that this rebasing makes the economy "look better on paper" without necessarily signifying real economic growth or improved living standards for Nigerians [11]. The rebasing aimed to capture emerging industries, shifting consumption patterns, informal economy activities, and digital technology growth, even including illicit activities like drug trade and sexual services (though these constitute less than 2% of the economy) [11].

Growth in 2025 is expected to be supported by stronger performance in sectors such as Finance & Insurance, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Construction, and Real Estate, alongside anticipated higher crude oil production [3]. Despite these positive drivers, Nigeria experienced a **0.7% annual decline** in real per capita GDP between 2014 and 2023, highlighting the need for more inclusive and sustained growth [1].

### Inflation Rates and Outlook

Inflation remains a significant concern for the Nigerian economy in 2025, persistently exceeding **20 percent** [1]. The IMF projects inflation to stay very high, reaching **26.5% in 2025** and further rising to **37.0% in 2026** [2]. However, there are signs of easing, with inflation recorded at **21.9% in July 2025**, supported by foreign exchange stability and targeted interventions by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) [3]. Headline inflation is expected to ease further to **21.46%** for H2 2025 [3]. Despite this anticipated moderation, elevated food and transport costs continue to persist, impacting consumer purchasing power [3].

Similar to GDP, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) base year was updated from 2009 to 2024 as part of the economic rebasing. This CPI rebasing, chosen to capture major structural changes like subsidy removals, saw inflation drop sharply from 34.8% in December 2024 to 24.48% in January 2025 [11].

### Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Stability

The Nigerian Naira is showing signs of stability in 2025 and is anticipated to remain broadly stable in H2 2025 [3]. This follows a period of significant depreciation, with historical data showing a decline from N21.89 in 1995 to N460.00 in 2022 against the US dollar [1].

The improved outlook for exchange rate stability is largely attributed to bold reforms initiated by the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2023 and 2024. These reforms include liberalizing the foreign exchange market, ending central bank financing of the fiscal deficit, and reforming fuel subsidies [1, 4]. These actions have bolstered investor confidence, leading to a resurgence of portfolio inflows and an increase in gross international reserves from $33.2 billion at end-2023 to $40.2 billion at end-2024 [1, 4]. A current account surplus of 9% of GDP in 2024 also supported this trend [4]. The new Dangote Refinery, which commenced production in January 2024 and is expected to begin refined oil exports in 2025, is also anticipated to significantly improve the current account by approximately $5.5 billion annually through import substitution and increased exports [4, 5].

However, exchange rate fluctuations have historically had asymmetric effects on the Nigerian economy. Upward swings (depreciation) in exchange rate volatility have shown a positive but insignificant impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the long run, while short-run depreciation significantly reduced FDI [1]. Depreciation also significantly increased inflation in both the short and long run [1]. Nigeria's import dependency and inelastic trade responses have meant no asymmetric consequences of exchange rate fluctuation on the balance of trade [1]. Risks to exchange rate stability include sovereign debt distress, negative oil price shocks, reduction in oil production due to deteriorating security, and food insecurity [5].

## Sectoral Performance

### Oil and Gas Sector

The oil and gas sector is expected to contribute positively to Nigeria's economy in 2025, despite global price moderation [4]. The sector is undergoing significant transformation, marked by International Oil Companies (IOCs) divesting assets and a new wave of ambitious indigenous players stepping in [5]. Notable mergers and acquisitions in 2024, such as Oando's $783 million acquisition of Nigerian Agip Oil Company and Chappal Energies' acquisition of a 10% interest in the SPDC joint venture, indicate a growing influence of local firms in upstream operations [6].

Infrastructure development is also a key driver, with the Dangote Refinery reaching 85% operational capacity, significantly reducing Nigeria's dependence on imported petroleum products [6]. The expansion of Nigeria LNG's Train 7 is supporting the "Decade of Gas" initiative, with gas projects playing a crucial role in boosting economic growth and driving industrialization [5, 6].

However, the sector faces persistent challenges, including oil theft, pipeline vandalism, and security risks, which drive up operating costs (estimated at $48 per barrel) [6]. Crude oil production in 2024 fluctuated and failed to meet the 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) target, and global trends like geopolitical tensions and increased competition from other suppliers have impacted Nigeria's market share [6]. For 2025, the outlook projects continued transformation, with indigenous companies further solidifying their position, shaped by ongoing regulatory adjustments and new investments with an emphasis on energy security and sustainability [6].

### Agriculture Sector

The agriculture sector is positioned for a positive performance in 2025. This is anchored on the successful completion of strategic investments by major players in 2024, growing domestic and regional demand for agricultural output, and planned interventions by the Federal Government, including tariff waivers on equipment importation [4]. According to the rebased figures for 2024, agriculture contributed a substantial **27.8% to GDP**, with crop production identified as one of the top five sectors driving GDP [11]. Government initiatives such as the Maize Aggregation Scheme and the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme are also providing support [1].

### Services Sector

The services sector continues to be the main growth driver for Nigeria's economy, contributing **55.5% of GDP** in 2024 (rebased figures) [11]. In Q1 2025, GDP growth was primarily driven by strong performance in the Finance & Insurance, ICT, Construction, and Real Estate sectors [2]. Trade, real estate, and telecommunications are identified as top sectors driving GDP, with real estate now contributing more than oil and gas, indicating significant economic diversification [11]. The rise in digital technology has generated numerous economic activities, including e-commerce and services like ride-hailing platforms [11].

The telecommunications sector, however, is expected to remain under pressure from foreign exchange dynamics, which will strain operational costs and profitability [4]. To combat this challenging environment, telecom giants are implementing strategies such as renegotiations of existing tower lease agreements and upward reviews of tariffs in Q1 2025 [4].

### Manufacturing Sector

In contrast to the services sector, the manufacturing sector has shown a concerning trend. Its share of GDP declined from 27.65% in 2014 to 21.08% in 2024, with the sector contracting [11]. This shift towards low-value services over a strong industrial base is seen by experts as undermining inclusive growth and job creation, with warnings that an economy driven by services rather than manufacturing could lead to stunted growth [11].

## Investment and Capital Flows

### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Trends

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Nigeria experienced a decline in Q1 2025, falling by 19% to $250 million, according to the central bank's balance of payments report [3]. In 2023, Nigeria experienced negative flows of -$187 million due to equity divestment, although its total FDI rose by 24% to $2 billion [9]. Despite these fluctuations, the future outlook for foreign investment in Nigeria looks promising, with the government actively making efforts to improve the business environment [7].

**Drivers of FDI:**
*   **Government Efforts and Reforms:** The Nigerian government promotes foreign investment through policies like the NIPC Act, offering incentives such as tax holidays, and is working to improve transparency, infrastructure, and political stability [7].
*   **Economic Diversification:** Efforts to diversify the economy have led to increased foreign investment in non-oil sectors [7].
*   **Market Potential:** Nigeria's large consumer market, abundant natural resources, and strategic location in Africa maintain high market potential [7].
*   **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA):** The AfCFTA agreement, which began trading in 2021, aims to integrate Africa's 1.3 billion people into a single market, with an Investment Protocol adopted in 2023, enhancing the continent's attractiveness [8].

**Sectors Attracting FDI:**
Historically, investment was driven by natural resources, particularly oil and gas, which still accounts for 73% of investment flows [7, 9]. However, foreign investment is broadening into high-potential sectors:
*   **Technology and Digital Economy:** Nigeria's tech start-up ecosystem, driven by a young, tech-savvy population and growing internet penetration, is attracting significant foreign investment in fintech, e-commerce, and IT services [7, 8, 9].
*   **Renewable Energy and Green Infrastructure:** Emerging areas include multi-billion-dollar green hydrogen projects and solar/wind farms [8, 9].
*   **Agriculture:** This is a key sector now attracting investment [7].
*   **Manufacturing and Industrialization:** These sectors are drawing significant capital [8].
*   **Agribusiness and Consumer Industries:** Attracting investment due to Africa's vast arable land and expanding middle class [8].

**Challenges and Risks for FDI:**
Challenges persist, including political instability, regulatory issues, corruption, currency fluctuations, inadequate infrastructure (especially electricity), and security concerns [7, 9]. Africa also faces the "Lucas Paradox," where despite high potential for capital returns, FDI flows remain low due to factors like lower productivity, limited human/public/institutional capital, information conflicts, and weak governance [9].

### Capital Importation

Nigeria's capital importation surged by **67.1% year-on-year to $5.64 billion in Q1 2025** from $3.38 billion in Q1 2024 [2]. However, this significant growth was predominantly driven by **Portfolio investments**, which constituted about 92% of total inflows and grew by 150.8% to $5.2 billion [2]. In contrast, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) grew by only 6% to $126.29 million, highlighting a reliance on more volatile portfolio flows rather than long-term direct investments [2].

## Consumer Spending Patterns

Consumer spending in Nigeria is projected to rise in 2025 despite persistent inflation. A report forecasts that consumer spending by Nigerian households will increase by **six percent in 2025** [8]. The total consumer spending in Nigeria is forecast to amount to **US$126.40 billion in 2025** [7]. Household disposable income per capita is forecast to reach **US$700.54** in the same year [7].

Specific per capita spending forecasts for 2025 include:
*   Food and non-alcoholic beverages: US$330.14
*   Housing: US$22.32
*   Healthcare: US$10.10
*   Clothing and footwear: US$26.85
*   Household: US$32.76
*   Hospitality and restaurants: US$1.50
*   Communication: US$14.15
*   Transport: US$30.77 [7]

Key trends shaping consumer behavior include the rise of e-commerce, a growing demand for sustainable consumption, personalized experiences, and technological advancements [7]. Nigeria's demographics play a crucial role, as it is Africa's most populous nation and is projected to be the world's third most populous by 2050, driven by a high fertility rate and increasing life expectancy [7].

## Government Policy Changes and Fiscal Landscape

### Monetary Policy

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has maintained a tight monetary policy stance to curb inflation. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) was held at **27.5% in July 2025** [3]. The CBN is also developing a roadmap to adopt inflation targeting and has implemented a new foreign exchange intervention (FXI) framework [5]. Policy recommendations emphasize maintaining this tight monetary policy stance to further curb inflation [4].

### Fiscal Policy and Public Debt

Fiscal pressures remain a significant challenge despite some relief in the debt-to-GDP ratio following the rebasing of the economy [2]. Nigeriaâ€™s total public debt grew by **22.8% year-on-year, from â‚¦121.67 trillion in Q1 2024 to â‚¦149.4 trillion in Q1 2025** [3]. The national debt-to-GDP ratio significantly increased to N138 trillion (58.3%) in 11 months of 2024 from N97.3 trillion (40.1%) in 2023 [4]. A rising concern is the proportion of revenue allocated to interest payments, projected to increase from 41.1% in 2024 to 58.0% by 2030, leaving insufficient funds for investment in people and infrastructure [1, 5].

A neutral fiscal stance in 2025 is recommended to safeguard stability, prioritizing growth-enhancing investments and the expansion of cash transfers to vulnerable households [4]. Strengthening revenue mobilization is critical, given Nigeria's persistently low collection ratios [4]. Tax reform bills have been approved, aiming for 4.2% of GDP in permanent revenue gains [5]. The tax-to-GDP ratio fell, necessitating significant collection boosts in 2025 [11].

### Key Reforms and Initiatives

The Nigerian government and CBN initiated bold reforms in 2023, including liberalizing the foreign exchange market, ending central bank financing of the fiscal deficit, reforming fuel subsidies, and strengthening revenue collection [1]. These actions have led to increased international reserves, Nigeriaâ€™s return to international capital markets, and rating agency upgrades [1].

Specific policy changes and initiatives for 2025 include:
*   **Tax Reforms:** Four landmark tax reforms were enacted in June 2025 to boost non-oil revenue, with proposed reforms expected to unlock N7.5 billion annually for fiscal sustainability [2, 4].
*   **Banking Sector Recapitalization:** This is highlighted as vital for achieving Nigeria's $1.0 trillion economy ambition by 2030, promising wealth and job creation, and foreign capital attraction [4]. The banking sector is largely positive due to progress in recapitalization [4].
*   **Oil and Gas Regulatory Reforms:** New tax incentives and policies have been introduced to streamline approvals and promote local content, such as the Midstream Petroleum Host Communities Development Trust [6].
*   **Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):** Efforts are underway to strengthen the AML/CFT framework to facilitate Nigeria's exit from the FATF grey list [4, 5]. The IMF continues to support Nigeria through capacity development in areas like tax policy, revenue administration, monetary and exchange rate policies, public financial management, financial stability, macroeconomic statistics, and AML/CFT compliance [5].
*   **Infrastructure and Human Capital:** Addressing infrastructure deficits (particularly electricity) and increasing spending on health and education are deemed essential structural reforms [4].

## Challenges, Risks, and Strategic Imperatives

Nigeria's economic outlook for 2025, while showing signs of stability and reform, is still subject to significant challenges and risks:

**Challenges and Factors Hindering Growth:**
*   **Persistent High Inflation:** This remains a major concern, eroding consumer purchasing power and increasing input costs [2].
*   **Poor Infrastructure:** Especially for electricity, poor infrastructure inhibits economic activity [1].
*   **Poverty and Food Insecurity:** Poverty remains high, with a 42% poverty rate in 2023, and food insecurity persists [1, 3].
*   **Oil Dependency:** Nigeria's reliance on oil (30% of government revenues in 2024) exposes it to volatile international prices and global demand fluctuations [1, 2].
*   **Structural Rigidities:** Deep-rooted structural problems continue to hinder economic progress [2].
*   **Weakening External Position:** The current account surplus is expected to decrease from 9.1% of GDP in 2024 to 6.9% in 2025, and further to 5.2% in 2026, suggesting potential pressure on the Naira and reserves [2].
*   **High Public Debt:** The growing public debt and the increasing share of revenue allocated to interest payments limit investment in critical areas [1, 3].
*   **Business Costs:** The removal of fuel subsidies and foreign exchange market liberalization have increased short-term business costs, particularly for SMEs due to tighter monetary policy [2].
*   **Manufacturing Decline:** The contraction of the manufacturing sector and its declining share of GDP raise concerns about inclusive growth and job creation [11].

**Risks:**
*   High-likelihood, short-term, high-impact risks include sovereign debt distress, negative oil price shocks or reduction in oil production due to deteriorating security, and food insecurity [5].
*   Climate events pose considerable risks to Nigeria's macroeconomic stability, growth, and fiscal sustainability [4].
*   Persistent geopolitical tensions also present ongoing risks [4].

**Strategic Imperatives and Recommendations:**
To navigate these challenges and unlock Nigeria's substantial potential, several strategic imperatives and policy recommendations have been highlighted:
*   **Sustained Reforms:** Continued implementation of reforms, particularly those aimed at improving the business environment and enhancing security, is crucial for attracting more foreign direct investment and achieving a stable inflation rate [1, 4].
*   **Fiscal Sustainability:** Strengthening fiscal sustainability through enhanced revenue mobilization and an effective budget framework with realistic assumptions and transparent reporting is paramount [1, 2, 4].
*   **Monetary Policy Coordination:** Enhancing monetary policy coordination to curb inflation while supporting growth is essential [2].
*   **Inclusive Growth:** Expanding the cash transfer system and establishing an effective social safety net are vital to carry the most vulnerable along and achieve stronger, more sustained, and inclusive growth [1].
*   **Investment in Key Sectors:** Continuously increasing domestic revenues to fund essential investments in areas like agriculture, infrastructure (especially electricity), health, and education is critical [1, 4]. Providing low-interest loans for local production, particularly in agriculture, can mitigate inflation and enhance supply chain security [1].
*   **Leveraging Megatrends:** Proactively responding to risks by leveraging megatrends like AI, digitalization, and green finance can drive innovation and efficiency [2, 3].
*   **Business Model Reinvention:** Businesses are advised to reinvent models for agility and customer-centricity, reignite market strategies, rethink costs, reimagine technology and AI integration, redefine funding, re-evaluate talent strategies, and reassess stakeholder relationships [3].

## Conclusion

Nigeria's economic trajectory for 2025 presents a mixed but cautiously optimistic outlook. The government's bold reforms have laid a foundation for macroeconomic stability, evidenced by a stabilizing Naira and increased international reserves. Modest GDP growth is anticipated, driven by key service sectors and a transforming oil and gas industry. However, the persistent challenge of high inflation continues to impact consumer purchasing power and business costs. While capital importation has surged, the dominance of portfolio investments over direct investment highlights a need for deeper, more stable foreign capital inflows. The rebasing of the economy provides a new statistical lens but underscores the ongoing struggle for real, inclusive growth that translates into improved living standards for the average Nigerian. Addressing structural issues such as inadequate infrastructure, high public debt, and the decline of the manufacturing sector, alongside sustained and disciplined policy execution, will be critical for Nigeria to unleash its full economic potential and achieve its long-term development goals.
